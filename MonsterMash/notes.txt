forgot that once in system, if not root body object (which is system position)
all positions need to be relative to parent body, so we can change radius.
this could result in seperation if two bodies shrink? need two way relative if origin of second is outside the first's radius ouch


BodyInSystemParent
	m_parentPart
	parentAnchorRadiusRelativeX
	parentAnchorRadiusRelativeY
	childAnchorRadiusRelativeX
	childAnchorRadiusRelativeY
	m_arrayChildrenPart = []
