//so why did london use cards to give actions? randomness? 
//use time of day, location, random to determin if events can occur

//all scenes give you the 4 core choices? fight, flight, passive engage, think
// percentile chance of sucess? your core / (difficulty + your core) < random
//  or several sorts of resolutions, random, core / difficulty < random. core + skill + random < difficulty 
//looking at inentory is the same as choosing think

failure is worth half (quater?) experence. still costs energy to perform, adds to negative accumulation (needs)
success adds smaller amount (or nothing?) to needs

alchohole? enery dirnks~ magic potions

or success increaces core, failure increces need. either cost stat
stats are recovered (reduced) through sleep.
